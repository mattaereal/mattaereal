### Hello stranger ðŸ‘€

Hey, I'm Matt, and this profile is a work in progress, but thanks for stopping by.

I'm currently on a break from work, studying blockchain development and security. I'm not open to working yet but will be at the end of the year.

I have before worked in the infosec industry, doing many things. I have been exploiting my soft skills in roles related to management, coaching, and mentoring for the past three years.

I am a mentor in some local communities, and always willing to help anybody trying to start a career in information security.

I started to generate content on my blog, here there are some of the latest articles:

_Do we, as a society, want the comfort and convenience of increasingly technologic, invisible digital integration enough to pay for those benefits with the liberties that must be given up to be protected from the downsides of that integration? - *Dan Geer*_
