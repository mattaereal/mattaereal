### Hello stranger ðŸ‘€

Hey, I'm matt, also known as matta, thanks for stopping by!

I'm currently a proud adventurer of a co-founded non-profit impactful organization named @theredguild, doing quests in the Ethereum Ecosystem, [hop on by](https://theredguild.org)!
I'm also part of the Technical Council and Initiative Lead at the [Security Alliance](securityalliance.org). Join me in my mission to improve the [Security Frameworks](frameworks.securityalliance.org)!

I have worked in the infosec industry before, having done _many many_ things, and I consider myself to be a digital knowmad, also exploiting my soft skills in roles related to management, coaching, and mentoring for several years now.

I am a mentor in some local communities, and I am always willing to help anybody trying to start a career in information security.

I started generating content on my blog before I started wearing the red. Here are some of my favorite articles although a bit outdated now:
- [What's a computer hacker? and other popular questions](https://medium.com/@mattaereal/whats-a-computer-hacker-and-other-popular-questions-c147b9a50f58)
- [A journey into smart contract security](https://medium.com/@mattaereal/a-journey-into-smart-contract-security-3115ff480f28)

I also generate content on the guild's blog, where you can view my latest work (https://blog.theredguild.org).

_Do we, as a society, want the comfort and convenience of increasingly technological, invisible digital integration enough to pay for those benefits with the liberties that must be given up to be protected from the downsides of that integration? - *Dan Geer*_
