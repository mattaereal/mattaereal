### Hello stranger ðŸ‘€

Hey, I'm Matt, and this profile is a work in progress, but thanks for stopping by.

I'm currently on a break from work, studying blockchain development and security. I'm not open to work yet, but will be at the end of the year.

I have previously worked in the infosec industry, doing many things, and for the past three years I have been exploiting my soft skills on roles more related to management, coaching, and mentoring.

I'm actually a mentor on some local communities, and willing to help anybody trying to start a carreer in information security.
